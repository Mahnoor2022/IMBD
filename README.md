The dataset contains 50000 rows and 2 columns (review, sentiment). There were no missing values or duplicates to remove, so the final dataset shape remains 50000 rows and 2 columns.
Missing Value Handling Columns with missing values: None. No missing value handling was necessary.
Key Findings from Data Visualization Sentiment Distribution: The dataset has a balanced number of positive and negative reviews (25000 each). Word Frequency: While specific word frequencies weren't directly visualized, the code performs preprocessing to remove stop words and lemmatize the text, indicating a focus on reducing noise and focusing on meaningful words. TF-IDF Analysis: The code uses TF-IDF vectorization, suggesting an exploration of words with high importance in distinguishing positive and negative reviews.
Next Steps The code trains sentiment classification models using Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, and SGD Classifier (as an SVM alternative), indicating a comparative approach to model selection. Further steps might involve exploring different vectorization techniques, hyperparameter tuning, and potentially using more advanced models to improve accuracy.
This summary highlights the key steps taken in data preprocessing, visualization, and model training for sentiment classification. Further improvements can be made by tuning hyperparameters or exploring more advanced models.
